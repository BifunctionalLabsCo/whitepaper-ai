# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the course learning experience by automatically curating and providing relevant resource links for each module within a generated course. After a course is successfully created from a whitepaper, each module will include a collection of high-quality, relevant external resources (articles, videos, documentation, tutorials) that provide in-depth understanding of the module's topics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to see relevant external resources for each course module, so that I can gain deeper understanding of the topics covered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a course is successfully generated THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and curate relevant resources for each module
2. WHEN a user views a module THEN the system SHALL display a "Resources" section with curated links
3. WHEN a user clicks on a resource link THEN the system SHALL open the resource in a new tab/window
4. IF no relevant resources are found for a module THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating resources are being curated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want resource links to be high-quality and directly relevant to the module content, so that I don't waste time on irrelevant materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are curated THEN the system SHALL filter resources based on relevance score above a minimum threshold
2. WHEN resources are displayed THEN the system SHALL show resource type (article, video, documentation, tutorial)
3. WHEN resources are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a brief description of each resource
4. WHEN resources are curated THEN the system SHALL prioritize authoritative sources and recent content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to see different types of resources (articles, videos, documentation), so that I can choose my preferred learning format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are curated THEN the system SHALL include multiple resource types when available
2. WHEN resources are displayed THEN the system SHALL group resources by type (articles, videos, documentation, tutorials)
3. WHEN resources are displayed THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators for each resource type
4. IF a resource type has no available content THEN the system SHALL not display that section

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a course creator, I want the resource curation to happen automatically after course generation, so that learners have immediate access to supplementary materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a course generation is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger resource curation for all modules
2. WHEN resource curation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators in the module resource sections
3. WHEN resource curation fails for a module THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a retry option
4. WHEN resource curation is completed THEN the system SHALL update the module display with the curated resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to track which resources I've visited, so that I can manage my learning progress effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a resource link THEN the system SHALL mark that resource as visited for that user
2. WHEN a user views a module THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish visited resources from unvisited ones
3. WHEN a user views their course progress THEN the system SHALL include resource engagement metrics
4. IF a user has visited all resources in a module THEN the system SHALL indicate module resource completion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor resource curation quality and performance, so that I can ensure the feature provides value to learners.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are curated THEN the system SHALL log curation metrics (success rate, processing time, resource count)
2. WHEN resource curation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN users interact with resources THEN the system SHALL track engagement metrics (click-through rates, time spent)
4. WHEN resource quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag resources for manual review
